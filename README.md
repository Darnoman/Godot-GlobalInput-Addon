# Godot-GlobalInput-Addon
Download and drag GlobalInput's addon folder in your project's addon folder.

Activate the addon.

It adds a GlobalInput singleton/addon.

Note: This was written in C# and uses System User32.dll, (so I think it'll only work on windows)

It has is_action_pressed, is_action_just_pressed, and is_action_just_released
